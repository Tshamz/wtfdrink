a re-re-re-factor of everyone's favorite site, [whatthefuckshouldidrinktonight.com](http://whatthefuckshouldidrinktonight.com) (a.k.a. [wtfdrink](http://wtfdrink.com))

## Current Version
This iteration of the project is written in vanilla js w/ zero dependencies.

## Prior Versions
Past iterations have included, but are not limited to:
  - the first website I ever built
  - php site w/ mysql databases for prompts and drink data
  - experimenting with writting javascript in module pattern
  - foray into facebook og api and sharing directly to a dedicated box on your timeline (R.I.P.)
